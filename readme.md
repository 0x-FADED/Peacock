# The Peacock Project

If you are reading this, you should probably know what you are doing. But If
you're a bit less technologically advanced person
like [the writer](https://github.com/Tinosaurus) of this readme, I will leave
you nice and simple readme instructions.

## Installation

Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/). Use the Latest version, or the version
specifically mentioned here: **Version 18**

Clone the repository where-ever you wish.

Open Windows terminal **AS ADMINISTRATOR**

Install yarn, by typing:

> corepack enable

Then move to the folder where you cloned the repo to by using:

> cd Folder/Path/Here

then install the dependencies by using:

> yarn install

## Usage

The project is bundled with a server running configuration.
Run that when editing the project with the IDE of choice, and it should open.
I'm not really sure what should I add here.

## Contributing

Writing bug reports is cool. You should do that. Or update this readme whenever
it's needed.

Thank you to people who have contributed!

## License

Peacock is proprietary, see the license file for more info.
